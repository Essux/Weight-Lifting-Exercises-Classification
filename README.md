# Weight-Lifting-Exercises-Classification

Final project for the course [*Practical Machine Learning*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning) from Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization on Coursera.

The [Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) contains sensor data of multiple individuals performing weight lifting exercises in five different fashions, the correct way and 4 common mistakes. The task is to be able to classify between the 5 classes in order to detect if an individual is doing the exercise correctly and how to correct it.

Multiple Tree Based models where trained and evaluated yielding a maximum performance on the test set of 99.36% accuracy using a Random Forest model.
